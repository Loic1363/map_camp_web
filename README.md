# MapCamp – Account-based marker workspace

MapCamp is a minimalist, production-style web application that lets you create,
edit and manage geolocated markers on top of an interactive Leaflet map.

Each marker is stored **per user account** in a SQLite database via a small
Node.js/Express backend. Close your browser, change device – your workspace is
still there when you come back.
